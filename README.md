# Criminal-Data-Insights

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing crime data to identify patterns, trends, and insights. By leveraging Python, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Power BI, and Microsoft Excel, the project aims to assist in understanding crime statistics for informed decision-making and improved public safety strategies.
The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights, visualize crime distribution, and enhance understanding of factors influencing criminal activities across regions.

# Features
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Removed inconsistencies and missing values in the dataset.
Standardized data formats (e.g., dates, categories).
3. Statistical Analysis
Calculated crime frequency, average crime rates, and district-level statistics.
Explored temporal trends (e.g., monthly or yearly crime rates).
4. Visualization with Power BI
Developed interactive dashboards showcasing crime by district, street, and category.
Created heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs for visual analysis.
5. Predictive Insights
Highlighted potential hotspots and time periods prone to criminal activity.
Analyzed patterns to support future crime prevention strategies.
6. Reporting

# Tools and Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook):Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
Tasks: Data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization.

# Data Source
The dataset includes information such as:
Crime Categories: Types of crimes (e.g., theft, assault, fraud).
Locations: Districts, streets, or other geographical information.
Time Details: Dates, months, or years when crimes occurred.

# Key Insights
District-Level Trends: Identified high-crime districts and their associated crime categories.
Temporal Analysis: Found specific months with spikes in criminal activity.
Heatmaps: Highlighted areas with higher crime rates.
Category Analysis: Common types of crimes and their distribution over time.
